# Regret-Minimization-in-GAN

This is implementation of Regret Minimization in Simple Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) by which convergence rate can be improved. This project was in course "Algorithms and Optimization for Big Data".

Here MNIST dataset is used for training GAN.

Regret Minimization is implemented using windowing technique proposed in the attached Research Paper.

Below is the comparison for Non-Regret and with Regret implementation.
